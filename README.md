# AndroidBarcodeScanner
A barcode scanner libary for Xamarin.Android


As of now you can't get the result from the scanner. WIP

Download code.
Add Camera permission in camera manifest.
Check Camera runtime permission.
Start scanner intent or scanner fragment.

Some code is from [https://github.com/xamarin/GooglePlayServicesComponents/tree/master/vision/samples](https://github.com/xamarin/GooglePlayServicesComponents/tree/master/vision/samples) 
and some code is a port I made from the java sample app [https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vision](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vision)
